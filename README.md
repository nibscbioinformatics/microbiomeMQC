Description: This package is designed to be used alsongside the WHO International Reference Reagents for the microbiome. Using strain, species or genera abundance tables generated through bioinformatics analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing or shotgun sequencing which included a reference reagent. This package will calculate measures of sensitivity, FPRA, diversity, and similarity based on mean average abundances with respect to the reference reagent.
